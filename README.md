<b>CHALLENGE</b>

To develop a mobile personal security app, designed to work as a 24/7 monitored alarm system, specifically for women at high risk of lethal violence from intimate partners. 
<br>

Suggested Functionality:
<ul>
<li>The app allows a person to fill out a basic security field.
<li>It will also have a checkbox option for people to indicate more in-depth information is being collected and submitted through their advocate. (We will provide these documents to the participants who choose to do this challenge, in order for them to build a better solution.)
<li>When the alarm button is pressed within the app, the app alerts the security centre and transmits the user's current location.
<li>When the alarm button is triggered, the security centre will try and call the user. If the user does not say the code word or answer the phone, the security centre calls the police and sends them the user's location and all pre-entered information about the user.
